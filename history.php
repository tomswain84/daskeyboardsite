        				<h2>How did it start?</h2>
        				<p>Back in 2005 in Austin, it all started from a personal quest to improve his own typing speed and accuracy, Metadot founder and “Uber Geek” Daniel Guermeur (Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/supercobra" target="_blank" title="Twitter">@supercobra)</a> created a totally blank keyboard. His typing speed doubled after just a few weeks of use. Many friends and colleagues who tested the keyboard were mesmerized and wanted one and Das Keyboard was born.</p>
